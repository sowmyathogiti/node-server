## Logging on Heroku
A Heroku app’s logs are aggregated from the output streams of all of its running processes, system components, and backing services. Heroku’s Logplex routes log streams from all of these diverse sources into a single channel, providing a foundation for comprehensive logging.
## Types of logs
- Runtime logs
- Build logs
## Log retrieval:
* Timestamp - The date and time recorded at the time the log line was produced by the dyno or component. The timestamp is in the format specified by RFC5424, and includes microsecond precision.
* Source - All of your app’s dynos (web dynos, background workers, cron) have the source, app. All of Heroku’s system components (HTTP router, dyno manager) have the source, heroku.
* Dyno - The name of the dyno or component that wrote the log line. For example, worker #3 appears as worker.3, and the Heroku HTTP router appears as router.
* Message - The content of the log line. Lines generated by dynos that exceed 10000 bytes are split into 10000 byte chunks without extra trailing newlines. Each chunk is submitted as a separate log line.
